# Advance Statistics

## Data Exploration
Data exploration is the process of examining and analyzing data to discover patterns, relationships, and insights. It involves using various statistical and visualization techniques to understand the characteristics of the data, identify anomalies and outliers, and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying structure of the data.

## Data Preprocessing
### - Data Transformation
Data transformation refers to the process of converting raw data from one format, structure, or representation to another format that is more suitable for analysis or processing. The transformation process can involve a wide range of techniques, including data cleaning, data normalization, data aggregation, and feature engineering.

### - Feature Selection
Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (or variables) from a larger set of features in a dataset. The objective of feature selection is to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning models by eliminating irrelevant or redundant features that do not contribute much to the performance of the model.

### - Cross Validation
Cross-validation is a statistical method used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by dividing the available dataset into multiple subsets, or "folds." The model is trained on a subset of the data and tested on the remaining subset. This process is repeated multiple times with different subsets of the data, and the performance of the model is averaged over all the runs.
